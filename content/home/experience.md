  description = """As a software developer, I was responsible for developing and maintaining software applications for the company. In addition to my development tasks, I also had leadership responsibilities for a software team. I was the final decision maker for all technical decisions related to the software design and for the operational processes within the team. I coordinated planning and task delegation within the team, defined issues and planned sprints.

I translated management requests into actionable items for the team and ensured that sprint processes were well-coordinated. I led, coached, and motivated the team, and conducted regular performance reviews. I maintained contact with external collaboration partners and was jointly responsible for budget management of the software development team.

I achieved several milestones in my role, including setting up a software team from two developers to a team of six developers, creating a functional CI/CD pipeline to accelerate development, and planning, building, and launching a new product within a month."""
